## DISCOVERY METHODS FOR FINDING MORE SOURCES

### Method 1: Conference Circuit Mining
Lion & Lamb's Tabernacles event brings together speakers from across the movement.
Check speaker lists from recent Tabernacles, Shavuot, and other conference events.
Each speaker likely has their own ministry with content.

Known conference speakers (from Lion & Lamb 2025):
- Monte Judah
- Eddie Chumney
- Mike Clayton
- Mike Hamilton
- Daniel Musson
- Dr. Miles Jones' Team
- Mondo De La Vega
- Marcel Murray
- Brian Serrano

Each of these should be searched individually for ministry websites and YouTube channels.

### Method 2: Messianic Marketplace Catalog
messianicmarketplace.org lists teaching resources from multiple ministries.
Browse their catalog to discover teachers and ministries with available content.

### Method 3: Link Lists / Directories
- restorationoftorah.org/messianic-links (already harvested above)
- yhwhisone.wordpress.com/torah-teaching-messianic-sites/
- Search for other "Messianic ministry links" or "Hebrew Roots resources" directories

### Method 4: YouTube Algorithm
Start with known channels, check their "Featured Channels" / "Related Channels"
sections. YouTube's recommendation engine clusters similar content creators.

### Method 5: Podcast Cross-References
Listen to guest appearances — when Teacher A appears on Teacher B's podcast,
Teacher A likely has their own content library. Lion & Lamb's "Come to the Table"
and "The Lion's Share" programs feature regular guests.

### Method 6: FFOZ Network
First Fruits of Zion collaborates with specific scholars and teachers.
Check their contributor lists, conference speakers, and recommended resources.

### Method 7: R.L. Solberg's "Torahism" Response Network
Solberg critiques the movement; the teachers he engages with and debates
are by definition significant voices. David Wilber (who responded to Solberg)
may have his own teaching content worth investigating.

## SOURCES TO APPROACH WITH CAUTION

These are included for completeness but should be flagged in metadata:

- **Michael Rood / A Rood Awakening**: TWI background, Christology questions,
  financial controversies. Content is influential but contested.
- **Sacred Name Movement sources**: Different theological stream that overlaps
  with Hebrew Roots but has distinct positions on divine name pronunciation.
- **Two-House extremist positions**: Some teachers take two-house theology
  into British Israelism or other fringe territory. Flag appropriately.
