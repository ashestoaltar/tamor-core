# Tamor Roadmap Governance

**Purpose:**  
Define how the Tamor roadmap evolves without losing clarity, trust, or stability.

---

## Document Roles

### 1. Roadmap.md
- Authoritative
- Versioned
- Slow-changing
- Represents committed direction only

### 2. Roadmap-extensions.md
- Idea intake
- Evaluation space
- Non-authoritative
- Intentionally expansive

### 3. This Document
- Defines the rules that govern promotion and change

---

## Promotion Rules

An item may be promoted from Extensions to the Roadmap only if:

1. It maps cleanly to an existing phase  
2. Scope is explicitly bounded  
3. Dependencies are understood  
4. It improves stability, clarity, or capability  
5. It does not blur deterministic vs probabilistic behavior  

---

## Stability Principles

- Determinism beats cleverness
- Clarity beats features
- Governance beats velocity
- Roadmap churn is avoided by design

---

## Scope Boundary

This roadmap applies **only to Tamor**.

- Business systems
- Employer tooling
- Client-specific assistants

→ These belong in **separate roadmaps** and must never leak in.

---

## Change Logging

Every roadmap change must include:
- A version bump
- A dated changelog entry
- A short rationale

---

## Final Note

Tamor is designed to grow **deliberately**.

Ideas are welcomed.  
Promotion is earned.
