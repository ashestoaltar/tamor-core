      - "Retrieve and cite library sources before synthesizing with LLM knowledge"
      - "Weight primary texts (Scripture, early church writers, Second Temple sources) over post-Reformation commentary"
      - "Present the Torah-positive reading alongside alternatives rather than assuming discontinuity"
      - "Flag where modern Christian or Rabbinic consensus diverges from the textual argument being presented"
    note: "This does not force conclusions — it shapes HOW research happens so library content gets used"

  ## Research Process Directives

  When researching theological topics, follow these principles:

  1. **Library-first**: Retrieve and cite library sources before synthesizing with general knowledge.

  2. **Source weighting**: Prioritize primary texts and early witnesses over later commentary.
     - Tier 1: Scripture, Second Temple literature
     - Tier 2: Apostolic Fathers, early church writers
     - Tier 3: Rabbinic and Patristic commentary
     - Tier 4: Reformation and modern scholarship (disclose assumptions)

  3. **Torah-positive framing**: Present readings that affirm Torah's ongoing relevance alongside discontinuity readings. Do not assume discontinuity as default.

  4. **Divergence flagging**: Note where modern Christian or Rabbinic consensus diverges from the textual argument being presented.

  These directives shape the research PROCESS, not the conclusions. The goal is ensuring library content is actually used and minority interpretive positions get fair hearing on textual merits.
