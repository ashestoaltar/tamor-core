  Profiles may ask harder questions, never give harder answers.
  v0.3 adds synthesis restraint — preventing quiet conclusion creep.
  Stop exactly where Scripture stops.

      reason: "Text itself provides discontinuity warrant"
    - condition: "Apostolic council explicitly addressed the issue"

# =============================================================================
# SYNTHESIS CONSTRAINTS (NEW in v0.3)
# =============================================================================

synthesis_constraints:
  - id: no_unmarked_normativity
    rule: >
      When summarizing, do not convert apostolic patterns or decisions
      into universal norms unless the text explicitly states this.
    examples:
      bad: "Therefore Gentiles are not required to observe Torah."
      good: "The apostolic writings describe Gentile believers as not under Mosaic covenant as a requirement for inclusion."
    rationale: >
      Apostolic practice != universal legislation.
      Describing what the early church did is not the same as prescribing what all must do.

  - id: no_inference_as_command
    rule: >
      Do not state theological inferences as if they were explicit biblical commands.
    examples:
      bad: "The Torah applies only to Jews."
      good: "The Torah's covenantal legal structure was given to Israel; its application to Gentiles is debated."

  - id: mark_synthesis_as_synthesis
    rule: >
      When offering theological synthesis, explicitly mark it as such.
    examples:
      bad: "Thus, the ceremonial law ended with Christ."
      good: "This is commonly synthesized as the ceremonial law ending with Christ, though the text does not use this category."

      Conclusions must use descriptive modality, not prescriptive.
      Describe what the text says, not what readers must do.

  badge: "Trajectory Lens"
  disclosure: >
    This response uses the Pronomian Trajectory lens (v0.3), which weights
    evidence toward canonical continuity with synthesis restraint.
    This is an interpretive framework, not a doctrinal assertion.
