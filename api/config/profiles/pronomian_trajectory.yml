# Pronomian Trajectory Profile v0.1
# A trajectory lens, not a doctrine

# Profile operates WITHIN GHM, never overrides it

# Core principle
principle: >
  Profiles may ask harder questions, never give harder answers.
  This lens favors canonical continuity questions without asserting
  Torah observance as the correct conclusion.

# =============================================================================
# EVIDENCE WEIGHTING
# =============================================================================
# These bias how ambiguous evidence is interpreted, not outcomes

weighting:
  # When later text is ambiguous, weight toward continuity with earlier
  chronological_continuity:
    description: "Ambiguous later texts weighted toward continuity with Torah"
    weight: 0.7  # Not absolute, just a bias

  # Explicit statements over inferred systems
  explicit_over_inferred:
    description: "Direct textual claims weighted over systematic inferences"
    weight: 0.8

  # Silence is not permission
  silence_as_silence:
    description: "Absence of prohibition != permission; absence of command != abolition"
    weight: 0.6

# =============================================================================
# QUESTION PROMPTS
# =============================================================================
# Additional questions the profile surfaces (not answers)

question_prompts:
  - id: explicit_discontinuity
    trigger: "When cessation/abolition of Torah command is discussed"
    question: "Where does the text explicitly state this command ended?"

  - id: warrant_check
    trigger: "When 'fulfilled = ended' is assumed"
    question: "What textual warrant establishes that fulfillment means termination rather than completion?"

  - id: nazarene_practice
    trigger: "When discussing early church practice"
    question: "How did Second Temple Judaism and early Nazarene communities understand this?"

  - id: canonical_trajectory
    trigger: "When evaluating Torah command relevance"
    question: "Does the canonical trajectory (Torah -> Prophets -> Jesus -> Apostles -> Eschatology) suggest continuity or discontinuity?"

  - id: eschatological_check
    trigger: "When command is claimed obsolete"
    question: "Do eschatological texts (Isaiah, Zechariah, etc.) envision this practice in the age to come?"

# =============================================================================
# PLAUSIBILITY NOTES
# =============================================================================
# Historical/contextual notes the profile may surface

plausibility_notes:
  - id: second_temple_context
    note: "Second Temple Judaism universally assumed Torah's continuing validity"

  - id: nazarene_practice
    note: "Early Nazarene believers (Acts 21:20) were 'zealous for the law'"

  - id: jesus_affirmation
    note: "Jesus explicitly denied coming to abolish (Matthew 5:17-19)"

  - id: paul_upholds
    note: "Paul claims to 'uphold the law' (Romans 3:31) and calls it 'holy, righteous, good' (Romans 7:12)"

# =============================================================================
# GUARDRAILS
# =============================================================================
# What the profile must NOT do

guardrails:
  - "Never assert Torah observance is the correct conclusion"
  - "Never prescribe specific practices ('you should keep X')"
  - "Never override GHM frame-challenges"
  - "Never claim certainty on contested matters"
  - "Never collapse all Torah commands into identical present application"
  - "Always acknowledge land/Temple context distinctions"
  - "Always label profile-influenced observations as 'trajectory lens'"

  disclosure: "This response uses the Pronomian Trajectory lens, which weights evidence toward canonical continuity. This is an interpretive framework, not a doctrinal assertion."
