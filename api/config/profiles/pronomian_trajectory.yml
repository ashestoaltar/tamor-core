  Profiles may ask harder questions, never give harder answers.
  v0.2 reduces noise and increases discrimination — smarter, not stronger.
  Questions are context-aware and better-timed, not more frequent.

      Ending something requires explicit reason; continuing is default unless stated.
      This is epistemic, not theological — it mirrors standard interpretive practice.

  disclosure: >
    This response uses the Pronomian Trajectory lens (v0.2), which weights
    evidence toward canonical continuity with context-sensitive discrimination.
    This is an interpretive framework, not a doctrinal assertion.
